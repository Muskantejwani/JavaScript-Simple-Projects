OIBSIP Task No: 01

Javascript Calculator

Calculator built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Can be controlled using either mouse / touchscreen or by using the keyboard pressing the 
corresponding keys.
The calculator interface is created using HTML elements like buttons, input fields, and a display screen. CSS is used to style the
interface, making it visually appealing and responsive for various screen sizes. JavaScript handles user interactions. When a button 
is clicked, the corresponding value (number or operator) is added to the input field, and the display is updated accordingly.
Implement functions to handle button clicks and update the input field and display. Develop functions for performing operations and 
evaluating expressions, attach event listeners to the calculator buttons to capture user interactions and trigger JavaScript functions
accordingly.

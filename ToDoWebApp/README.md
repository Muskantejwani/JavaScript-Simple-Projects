ToDO List Web-App

A to-do list web app is a simple but practical application that allows users to create, manage, and keep track of their tasks or to-do items.
Task Management: Users can easily add new tasks to the list by typing them into title and description and hitting the "Add" button. 
Each task is displayed as an item in the list.
Task Deletion: Completed or unwanted tasks can be removed from the list with a single click on a "Delete" button associated with each task.

Login and Registration authentication and validation 

Creating a registration and login form authentication system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several steps. Here, I'll providea basic example 
of how you can implement this using HTML, JavaScript, and localStorage to store user data. Please note that this is a simplified example
and should not be used for production-level security. For real-world applications, you should use a server-side authentication 
system with proper security measures.
